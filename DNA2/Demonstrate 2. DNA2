create suspect_1/_2/_3/_4/_5/_6 variables and set them to nothing

open all dna fragment files to different variables

open all suspect dna files to different variables

read all the suspect dna files to different variables

read all the dna fragment files to different variables

close all the dna fragment and the suspects dna files

find the dna fragments index in each suspect by using .find then add the index to different variables for each suspect and fragment

check if index of suspect 1 fragment 1 does not equal -1
    change variable suspect_1 to ", 1"

check if index of suspect 2 fragment 1 does not equal -1
    change variable suspect_2 to ", 2"

check if index of suspect 3 fragment 1 does not equal -1
    change variable suspect_3 to ", 3"

check if index of suspect 4 fragment 1 does not equal -1
    change variable suspect_4 to ", 4"

check if index of suspect 5 fragment 1 does not equal -1
    change variable suspect_5 to ", 5"

add all the variables of suspect_x to a str by using .format eg "{0}{1}{2}{3}{4}".format(suspect_1, suspect_2, etc, etc) and add that to a variable

use the [:] to get rid of the ", " from the very start of the string and add the edited str1 to a variable

get the last value of the str1 by using [-1] and add that to a variable

make a str2 eg ", " plus the variable of the last value of the str1 and add the to a variable

get the length of the str1 and add it to a variable

+ 1 onto the int of the length of str1 and add that to a variable

- 3 off the int of the length of str1 and add that to a variable

use the [:] method to get the ", 'last value'" eg [len +1 variable:len -3 variable] and add the str3 to a variable

replace the ", " in the str3 using .replace(", ", " and ") and add the new str4 to a variable

strip the last ''''", " + last value''' using .strip and add the new str5 to a variable

add str4 and str5 back together to form the new edited str and add that to a variable

print the new edited str by using .format eg "dna fragment 1 matches suspect {0}".format(str)

add a print() to seperate the nexted printed thing

set the suspect_1/_2/ect/ect to nothing to they can be use again
